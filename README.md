# Deep Learning (NumPy implementation)

This repository contains the following deep-learning modules implemented from scratch with NumPy.
- Multiple Layer Perceptions (deep feedforward neural network)
- 1D Convolutional Neural Network
- 2D Convolutional Neural Network
- Recurrent Neural Network

Folder "project" :
- evaluation: contain modules for assessing models
- examples: contain actual applications to demonstrate the models
- models: contain the main scripts for the models
- nn/modules: contain modules ingredients for the models
- optim: contain algorithms for optimization
- utils: contain utility functions for obtaining and processing data

Check out the demonstration examples here: https://github.com/weili-code/DeepLearning_numpy/tree/main/project/examples

Note: the code and examples in the repository are for pedagogical purposes and thus have not been enhanced for efficiency and performance, and may take significantly longer time than the counterpart of Pytorch modules. You can find some HTML files in the folder "examples" for concrete demonstration. 

A collection of illustrations of DL methods using PyTorch can be found in another repository here https://github.com/weili-code/DeepLearning_pytorch.
