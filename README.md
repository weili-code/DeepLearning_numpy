# Deep Learning (numpy implementation)

This repository contains the following four deep learning modules implemented with Numpy.
- Multiple Layer Perceptions (deep feedforward neural network)
- 1D Convolutional Neural Network
- 2D Convolutional Neural Network
- Recurrent Neural Network

Folder <project> :
- evaluation: contain modules for assess models
- examples: contain actual applications to demonstrate the models
- models: contain the main scripts for the models
- nn/modules: contain modules ingredients for the models
- optim: contain algorithms for optimization
- utils: contain utility functions for obtaining and processing data

Note: the code and examples in the repository are for pedagogical purpose and thus have not been enhanced for efficiency and performance, and may take significant longer time than the counterpart of Pytorch modules.
